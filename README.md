# Assigment1_VisualComputing
First Assigment in Visual Computing

To run this project you will need to download the pictures that are included and add them to project/out/build/x64-Debug.
After adding the pictures to the project you can download and add the files (main.cpp and CMakeList.txt) to the project.
In the main function at the bottom of main.cpp there are different functions that are commented out, you can comment them in and out for different picture sets, so that you can see different results. In the console you can see different print statments for different project requirements.
